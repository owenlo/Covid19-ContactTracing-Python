# Covid19-ContactTracing-Python
An example implementation of the Covid-19 Contact Tracing concept proposed by Apple/Google

A demo of the code is avaliable at https://repl.it/@owenlo/Covid19-ContactTracing-Simulation

Currently, the implementation will generate all necessary values for an individual (Trace Key,  Daily Trace Key and Rolling Proximity IDs) within a 24-hour period.
